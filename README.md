# Teaching-HEIGVD-RES-2020-Labo-Orchestra

## Admin

* **You can work in groups of 2 students**.
* It is up to you if you want to fork this repo, or if you prefer to work in a private repo. However, you have to **use exactly the same directory structure for the validation procedure to work**. 
* We expect that you will have more issues and questions than with other labs (because we have a left some questions open on purpose). Please ask your questions on Telegram / Teams, so that everyone in the class can benefit from the discussion.

## Objectives

This lab has 4 objectives:

* The first objective is to **design and implement a simple application protocol on top of UDP**. It will be very similar to the protocol presented during the lecture (where thermometers were publishing temperature events in a multicast group and where a station was listening for these events).

* The second objective is to get familiar with several tools from **the JavaScript ecosystem**. You will implement two simple **Node.js** applications. You will also have to search for and use a couple of **npm modules** (i.e. third-party libraries).

* The third objective is to continue practicing with **Docker**. You will have to create 2 Docker images (they will be very similar to the images presented in class). You will then have to run multiple containers based on these images.

* Last but not least, the fourth objective is to **work with a bit less upfront guidance**, as compared with previous labs. This time, we do not provide a complete webcast to get you started, because we want you to search for information (this is a very important skill that we will increasingly train). Don't worry, we have prepared a fairly detailed list of tasks that will put you on the right track. If you feel a bit overwhelmed at the beginning, make sure to read this document carefully and to find answers to the questions asked in the tables. You will see that the whole thing will become more and more approachable.


## Requirements

In this lab, you will **write 2 small NodeJS applications** and **package them in Docker images**:

* the first app, **Musician**, simulates someone who plays an instrument in an orchestra. When the app is started, it is assigned an instrument (piano, flute, etc.). As long as it is running, every second it will emit a sound (well... simulate the emission of a sound: we are talking about a communication protocol). Of course, the sound depends on the instrument.

* the second app, **Auditor**, simulates someone who listens to the orchestra. This application has two responsibilities. Firstly, it must listen to Musicians and keep track of **active** musicians. A musician is active if it has played a sound during the last 5 seconds. Secondly, it must make this information available to you. Concretely, this means that it should implement a very simple TCP-based protocol.

### Instruments and sounds

The following table gives you the mapping between instruments and sounds. Please **use exactly the same string values** in your code, so that validation procedures can work.

| Instrument | Sound         |
|------------|---------------|
| `piano`    | `ti-ta-ti`    |
| `trumpet`  | `pouet`       |
| `flute`    | `trulu`       |
| `violin`   | `gzi-gzi`     |
| `drum`     | `boum-boum`   |

### TCP-based protocol to be implemented by the Auditor application

* The auditor should include a TCP server and accept connection requests on port 2205.
* After accepting a connection request, the auditor must send a JSON payload containing the list of <u>active</u> musicians, with the following format (it can be a single line, without indentation):

```
[
  {
  	"uuid" : "aa7d8cb3-a15f-4f06-a0eb-b8feb6244a60",
  	"instrument" : "piano",
  	"activeSince" : "2016-04-27T05:20:50.731Z"
  },
  {
  	"uuid" : "06dbcbeb-c4c8-49ed-ac2a-cd8716cbf2d3",
  	"instrument" : "flute",
  	"activeSince" : "2016-04-27T05:39:03.211Z"
  }
]
```

### What you should be able to do at the end of the lab


You should be able to start an **Auditor** container with the following command:

```
$ docker run -d -p 2205:2205 res/auditor
```

You should be able to connect to your **Auditor** container over TCP and see that there is no active musician.

```
$ telnet IP_ADDRESS_THAT_DEPENDS_ON_YOUR_SETUP 2205
[]
```

You should then be able to start a first **Musician** container with the following command:

```
$ docker run -d res/musician piano
```

After this, you should be able to verify two points. Firstly, if you connect to the TCP interface of your **Auditor** container, you should see that there is now one active musician (you should receive a JSON array with a single element). Secondly, you should be able to use `tcpdump` to monitor the UDP datagrams generated by the **Musician** container.

You should then be able to kill the **Musician** container, wait 5 seconds and connect to the TCP interface of the **Auditor** container. You should see that there is now no active musician (empty array).

You should then be able to start several **Musician** containers with the following commands:

```
$ docker run -d res/musician piano
$ docker run -d res/musician flute
$ docker run -d res/musician flute
$ docker run -d res/musician drum
```
When you connect to the TCP interface of the **Auditor**, you should receive an array of musicians that corresponds to your commands. You should also use `tcpdump` to monitor the UDP trafic in your system.


## Task 1: design the application architecture and protocols

| #  | Topic |
| --- | --- |
|Question | How can we represent the system in an **architecture diagram**, which gives information both about the Docker containers, the communication protocols and the commands? |
| | ![your-UML-diagram-name](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/david-pellissier/Teaching-HEIGVD-RES-2020-Labo-Orchestra/master/resources/diagram.iuml) |
|Question | Who is going to **send UDP datagrams** and **when**? |
| | Musician's going to send UDP datagrams for every seconds |
|Question | Who is going to **listen for UDP datagrams** and what should happen when a datagram is received? |
| | Auditor's going to listen to the UDP datagrams, add the received datagrams to an array and check if the Musician is still alive after 5 seconds |
|Question | What **payload** should we put in the UDP datagrams? |
| | The musician's sound and UUID |
|Question | What **data structures** do we need in the UDP sender and receiver? When will we update these data structures? When will we query these data structures? |
| | UDP sender : a stringified JSON containing the musician's sound and UUID |
| | UDP receiver : a (JS)Map with the uuid as key and a pair with the instrument's type and the `date()` received |
| | We will update the data structures everytime the Auditor receive a sound and when it finds an inactive musician (>5sec inactivity) |
| | We will query the data structures when we get the JSON oject of the playing musicians and when the Auditor will delete the inactive ones |



## Task 2: implement a "musician" Node.js application

| #  | Topic |
| ---  | --- |
|Question | In a JavaScript program, if we have an object, how can we **serialize it in JSON**? |
| | with `JSON.stringify(<object>)`  |
|Question | What is **npm**?  |
| | From what I knew in the beginning of Node.js (before it was in its 1ˢᵗ version), the acronym stood for Not a Package Manager. But as of today, we can safely assume that it stands for Node Package Manager. And as it implies, it's a package manager for… well, Node.js.  |
|Question | What is the `npm install` command and what is the purpose of the `--save` flag?  |
| | from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36022926/what-do-the-save-flags-do-with-npm-install), is says that it installs the package and updates the dependencies in the `package.json`. Apparently, this is not necessary as it is now the default option.  |
|Question | How can we use the `https://www.npmjs.com/` web site?  |
| | Using the search field to look for a package that we might want to use ? Not really sure what's the question, but the website says that it's npm, Inc., the company behind "Node package manager" (and 2 other things) and they do love open source. It also offers the documentation for `npm`. |
|Question | In JavaScript, how can we **generate a UUID** compliant with RFC4122? |
| | Simply using the package soberly called `uuid` that says "For the creation of RFC4122 UUIDs". |
|Question | In Node.js, how can we execute a function on a **periodic** basis? |
| | with `setInterval(a_function(){}, time_in_ms);`.  |
|Question | In Node.js, how can we **emit UDP datagrams**? |
| | using the `dgram` node API. In the [example](https://nodejs.fandom.com/wiki/UDP/Datagrams) given in the `send` section, we can see that we must first create a socket, then we can send the message. |
|Question | In Node.js, how can we **access the command line arguments**? |
| | with `procress.argv` within the JS script. |


## Task 3: package the "musician" app in a Docker image

| #  | Topic |
| ---  | --- |
|Question | How do we **define and build our own Docker image**?|
| | using `docker build -t <image_tag> .` where the the `Dockerfile` is located.  |
|Question | How can we use the `ENTRYPOINT` statement in our Dockerfile?  |
| | In the same way of the `CMD` statement. The difference between those 2 is that one can not override the `ENTRYPOINT` instruction by adding command-line parameters to the `docker run` command.  |
|Question | After building our Docker image, how do we use it to **run containers**?  |
| | using `docker run [OPTIONS] <docker_image>`  |
|Question | How do we get the list of all **running containers**?  |
| | using `docker ps`  |
|Question | How do we **stop/kill** one running container?  |
| | using `docker kill <container_name>`  |
|Question | How can we check that our running containers are effectively sending UDP datagrams?  |
| | With an external tool such as Wireshark to check the network activity.  |


## Task 4: implement an "auditor" Node.js application

| #  | Topic |
| ---  | ---  |
|Question | With Node.js, how can we listen for UDP datagrams in a multicast group? |
| | Almost in the same way as the emitter but we have to bind the client to a specified port and address. |
|Question | How can we use the `Map` built-in object introduced in ECMAScript 6 to implement a **dictionary**?  |
| | The `Map`object already holds key-value pairs, so we just have to save the musicians' uuid with an array containing the other informations such as activeSince, etc. |
|Question | How can we use the `Moment.js` npm module to help us with **date manipulations** and formatting?  |
| | By using its differents mothods available such as add, subsctract. There is a [manipulation](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/manipulating/https://momentjs.com/docs/#/manipulating/) section. There is also a format method for… formatting. |
|Question | When and how do we **get rid of inactive players**?  |
| | We lookup every seconds the `Map` and if there is a player that's been `activeSince` more than 5 seconds, we delete it from the said `Map`. |
|Question | How do I implement a **simple TCP server** in Node.js?  |
| | By using the `net` node built-in API. There are plenty of examples of basic TCP server available throughout the Web. |


## Task 5: package the "auditor" app in a Docker image

                <li>
                    we can use the `validate.sh` script to do an ultimate check

        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

## Constraints

Please be careful to adhere to the specifications in this document, and in particular

* the Docker image names
* the names of instruments and their sounds
* the TCP PORT number

Also, we have prepared two directories, where you should place your two `Dockerfile` with their dependent files.

Have a look at the `validate.sh` script located in the top-level directory. This script automates part of the validation process for your implementation (it will gradually be expanded with additional operations and assertions). As soon as you start creating your Docker images (i.e. creating your Dockerfiles), you should try to run it.
